# Project 06: Black Line Detection with ADC

## Objective

Use analog sensors to detect black electrical tape on the floor and read values via the thumbwheel.

## What Was Done

- Assembled emitter/detector board
- Displayed ADC readings on LCD
- Car stopped when detecting the line and turned 90 degrees

## Key Takeaway

This introduced environmental sensing and set the stage for autonomous behavior.

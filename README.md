# AutoNav-IoT-LineFollower
IoT-enabled autonomous car developed for ECE 306 at NC State University. Navigates via Wi-Fi commands, autonomously detects and follows a black line, performs precise maneuvers, and displays real-time status on an LCD. Combines embedded firmware, sensor integration, and motor control.

# ECE 306: Autonomous Embedded Systems Car

This project is the culmination of a semester-long embedded systems course at NC State University (ECE 306), where I developed an autonomous car using a TI MSP430G2553 microcontroller. The course followed a modular progression of ten individual projects, each building on embedded systems fundamentals to gradually develop a fully functioning, sensor-guided robotic car. By the end, the car was capable of line-following navigation using ADC reflectance sensors and motor control via PWM signals.

## ðŸš— Project Overview

The autonomous car was built on a two-wheeled chassis with independent DC motor control, powered by a regulated battery supply. It used analog reflectance sensors to detect black lines on a track, feeding into the MSP430â€™s ADC for threshold-based decision-making. Motion was controlled via an H-bridge and software-generated PWM signals, while real-time feedback was displayed on an LCD. All software was written in embedded C with low-level register manipulation.

This project provided real-world, hands-on experience with microcontroller programming, hardware interfacing, and real-time system design. Each milestone introduced new subsystems or challenges, culminating in a final integrated autonomous vehicle.

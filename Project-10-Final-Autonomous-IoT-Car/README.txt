# Project 10: Final IoT and Autonomous Car Integration

## Objective

Merge all subsystems into a working autonomous car that:
1. Navigates a course via Wi-Fi
2. Transitions to autonomous black line detection and follows a loop

## What Was Done

- Consolidated all previous project code into one system
- Navigated from pad 0 to pad 8 via Wi-Fi commands
- Issued a single command to initiate autonomous line-following
- Followed black tape into a circle, did two rotations, and exited

## Display Requirements

- Display Wi-Fi connection info
- Show pad arrival status (`Arrived 0X`)
- During autonomous mode: display status like `BL Start`, `BL Turn`, etc.

## Key Takeaway

This project showcased the culmination of embedded software design, sensor integration, and wireless communication in an applied real-world robotics demo.

# Project 07: Black Circle Navigation

## Objective

Use line detection to circle a black ring twice and exit inward.

## What Was Done

- Implemented ADC polling with timers
- Used state machine to follow circle geometry
- Verified clean two-lap circle navigation and inner exit

## Key Takeaway

This was the first fully autonomous pattern based on environment sensing.

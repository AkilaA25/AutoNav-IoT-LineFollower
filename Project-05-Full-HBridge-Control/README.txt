# Project 05: Full H-Bridge Forward and Reverse

## Objective

Install the rest of the H-Bridge to enable full motor direction control: forward, reverse, and spin.

## What Was Done

- Added P-FETs and NFETs
- Used timer interrupts for timed direction changes
- Car moved forward, paused, reversed, and spun in place

## Key Takeaway

This expanded motion control for future navigation algorithms.

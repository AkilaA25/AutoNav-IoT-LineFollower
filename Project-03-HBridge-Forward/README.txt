# Project 03: Forward Movement with H-Bridge

## Objective

Enable forward-only motion using a partial H-Bridge circuit and a simple state machine.

## What Was Done

- Installed NFETs and jumpers
- Created basic motion sequence
- Validated car moved forward briefly and then stopped

## Key Takeaway

This marked the first successful movement of the car.

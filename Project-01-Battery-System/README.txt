# Project 01: Battery Power System

## Objective

Assemble and verify the carâ€™s power supply. This included mounting the battery holder, switch, and voltage regulator. Verification was done using a digital multimeter to ensure stable 3.3V output.

## What Was Done

- Soldered components to the Power Board
- Verified voltage output across key terminals
- Tested switch control of power delivery

## Key Takeaway

This project established the foundation for safe power delivery throughout the system.
